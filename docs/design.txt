Problem Statement: Create a program that prompts a user to input two letters that represent
each allele of a genotype. These letters should be B, b, and G. They are the eye color alleles for brown, blue,
and green. (Brown is dominant, Blue is recessive, and Green is dominant to Blue but recessive
to Brown). The program should create a genotype from the two inputted alleles and output the phenotype,
or the color that is physicaly represented by the genotype.

Nouns: letters, allele, genotype, phenotype

Verbs: input, create, output

// Defining Diagram //

Input: allele

Process:
  prompt user for the first letter for an allele
  prompt user for a second letter for an allele
  if the letter is not B, b, or G, alert the user to try again
  genotype is first letter plus second letter
  use switch statment to determine phenotype based on letter combinations
  display genotype
  display phenotype

Output:
  genotype combination
  phenotype color

// Pseudocode //

GenerateEyeColor 
  initialize variables
  prompt user for firstAllele with "What allele does the first parent give? B, b, or G?" 
  WHILE input is not 'B', 'G', or 'b'
    alert ""Invalid input! Please enter B, b, or G. Case sensitivity required"
  prompt user for secondAllele with "What allele does the second parent give? B, b, or G?"
  WHILE input is not 'B', 'G', or 'b'
    alert "Invalid input! Please enter B, b, or G. Case sensitivity required"
  set genotype to firstAllele + second Allele 
  IF genotype = bb
    THEN phenotype = blue
  IF genotype = bB
    THEN phenotype = Brown
  IF genotype = bG
    THEN phenotype = Green
  IF genotype = BB
    THEN phenotype = Brown
  IF genotype = Bb
    THEN phenotype = Brown
  IF genotype = BG
    THEN phenotype = Brown
  IF genotype = GG
    THEN phenotype = Green
  IF genotype = GB
    THEN phenotype = Brown
  IF genotype = Gb
    THEN phenotype = Green
    ELSE phenotype = null
  ENDIF
  display genotype as "The genotype for eyecolor is " + firstAllele + secondAllele
  display phenotype as "The phenotype for eyecolor is " + phenotype
END
  
// Testing //

Variables: firstAllele, secondAllele

TEST CASE 1:

Input: b, b

Expected Output:
  The genotype for your eye color is bb.
  The phenotype for your eye color is Blue. 

Actual Output:
  The genotype for your eye color is bb.
  The phenotype for your eye color is Blue.



TEST CASE 2:

Input: B, b

Expected Output:
  The genotype for your eye color is Bb.
  The phenotype for your eye color is Brown.  

Actual Output:
  The genotype for your eye color is Bb.
  The phenotype for your eye color is Brown.



TEST CASE 3:

Input: G, G

Expected Output:
  The genotype for your eye color is GG.
  The phenotype for your eye color is Green.

Actual Output:
  The genotype for your eye color is GG.
  The phenotype for your eye color is Green.




TEST CASE 4:

Input: G, g

Expected Output: 
  Invalid input! Please enter B, b, or G. Case sensitivity required

Actual Output:
  Invalid input! Please enter B, b, or G. Case sensitivity required
